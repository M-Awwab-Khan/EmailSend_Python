# EmailSend_Python

This is a simple email sender app created by me using python renowned library smtplib. It can send email to anyone from your email address

###Setup
1. Run app.py file and enter your gmail address and password. This is not your google account password but app password which can be created only after you enable 2 step verification. Earlier we used to enable "less secure apps" option in google account but it is not applicable as of now. So you need to enable two step verification and create an app password and paste it in the program when it asks.
2. Go into details.csv file and add reciever's email address. You can add as many recipents as you wish.
3. If you wish to change template of email, Just edit template.txt to as you like.
